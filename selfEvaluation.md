# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I'm actually feeling a lot more confident now that I worked through the CFU.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I actually really enjoyed figuring it out. I felt like I was right on the edge of solving one of the challenges and was struggling so I took a break and when I came back I felt a lot more fresh and I solved it.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to run through some more of the examples so I really understand how to work through arrays and if statements.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
